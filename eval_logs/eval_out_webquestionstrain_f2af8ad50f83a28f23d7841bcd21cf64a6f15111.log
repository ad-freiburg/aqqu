God's will be done, and if He decrees that we are to have a great number of children why we must try to bring them up as useful and exemplary members of society.", "I think people really marry far too much; it is such a lottery after all, and for a poor woman a very doubtful happiness.", "Since it has pleased Providence to place me in this station, I shall do my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young and perhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am sure that very few have more real good will and more real desire to do what is fit and right than I have.", "For a man to strike any women is most brutal, and I, as well as everyone else, think this far worse than any attempt to shoot, which, wicked as it is, is at least more comprehensible and more courageous."]

Finally, I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday endwhere all men and all churches are treated as equalwhere every man has the same right to attend or not attend the church of his choicewhere there is no Catholic vote, no anti-Catholic vote, no bloc voting of any kindand where Catholics, Protestants and Jews, at both the lay and pastoral level, will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past, and promote instead the American ideal of brotherhood. That is the kind of America in which I believe. And it represents the kind of Presidency in which I believea great office that must neither be humbled by making it the instrument of any one religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding its occupancy from the members of any one religious group. I believe in a President whose religious views are his own private affair, neither imposed by him upon the Nation or imposed by the Nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.", "Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.", "I am certain that after the dust of centuries has passed over our cities, we, too, will be remembered not for victories or defeats in battle or in politics, but for our contribution to the human spirit.", "We stand today on the edge of a new frontier -- the frontier of the 1960s, a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils, a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats.

All their cares, hopes, joys, affections, virtues, and associations seemed to be melted down into dollars. Whatever the chance contributions that fell into the slow cauldron of their talk, they made the gruel thick and slab with dollars. Men were weighed by their dollars, measures were gauged by their dollars; life was auctioned, appraised, put up, and knocked down for its dollars. The next respectable thing to dollars was any venture having their attainment for its end. The more of that worthless ballast, honor and fair-dealing, which any man cast overboard from the ship of his Good Nature and Good Intent, the more ample stowage-room he had for dollars.

When I got my life on purpose and focused on giving of myself and everything that arrived into my life, then I was prosperous.", "Our income are like our shoes; if too small, they gall and pinch us; but if too large, they cause us to stumble and trip.", "Money is always there but the pockets change.", "A nickel isn't worth a dime today.", "The Lord commonly gives riches to foolish people, to whom he gives nothing else.", "God shows his contempt for wealth by the kind of person he selects to receive it.", "His money is twice tainted: taint yours and taint mine.", "The lack of money is the root of all evils.", "Nowadays nothing but money counts: a fortune brings honors, friendships, the poor man everywhere lies low.", "Whatever you have spend less.", "Once upon a time only Washington's face was on our money, now Washington's hands are on it too.", "When money is taken freedom is forsaken.", "I know of nothing more despicable and pathetic than a man who devotes all the hours of the waking day to the making of money for money's sake.", "Money is like fire, an element as little troubled by moralizing as earth, air and water. Men can employ it as a tool or they can dance around it as if it were the incarnation of a god. Money votes socialist or monarchist, finds a profit in pornography or translations from the Bible, commissions Rembrandt and underwrites the technology of Auschwitz. It acquires its meaning from the uses to which it is put.", "The love of money grows as the money itself grows.", "If you are poor, though you dwell in the busy marketplace, no one will inquire about you; if you are rich, though you dwell in the heart of the mountains, you will have distant relatives.", "It doesn't matter whether you are rich or poor -- as long as you've got money.", "I don't like money actually, but it quiets the nerves.", "God makes, and apparel shapes; but it's money that finishes the man.", "Money begets money.", "Where gold speaks every tongue is silent.", "Money is a singular thing. It ranks with love as man's greatest source of joy. And with death as his greatest source of anxiety. Over all history it has oppressed nearly all people in one of two ways: either it has been abundant and very unreliable, or reliable and very scarce.", "It is not how much one makes but to what purpose one spends.", "It is a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.", "Those who are of the opinion that money will do everything may reasonably be expected to do everything for money.", "When money speaks the truth is silent.", "If you want to know what God thinks of money, look at the people he gives it to.", "Money often costs too much.", "There is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the poor. The poor can think of nothing else.", "I'm tired of love; I'm still more tired of rhyme; but money gives me pleasure all the time.", "Ready money is Aladdin's lamp.", "Money can't buy health, happiness, or what it did last year.", "The poor man's budget is full of schemes.", "When asked what would he do if he found $1 million, Yogi responded, If the guy was poor, I'd give it back.", "All riches have their origin in mind. Wealth is in ideas -- not money.", "All things are sold: the very light of heaven is venal; earth's unsparing gifts of love, the smallest and most despicable things that lurk in the abysses of the deep, all objects of our life, even life itself, and the poor pittance which the laws allow of liberty, the fellowship of man, those duties which his heart of human love should urge him to perform instinctively, are bought and sold as in a public mart of not disguising selfishness, that sets on each its price, the stamp-mark of her reign.", "Money is not required to buy one necessity of the soul.", "A fool and her money are soon courted.", "Almost any man knows how to earn money, but not one in a million knows how to spend it.", "Getting money is like digging with a needle, spending it is like water soaking into sand.", "The way by which you may get money almost without exception leads downward.", "Money differs from an automobile or mistress in being equally important to those who have it and those who do not.", "Money is like manure. You have to spread it around or it smells.", "The trick is to make sure you don't die waiting for prosperity to come.", "Why is there so much month left at the end of the money?", "When the strong box contains no more both friends and flatterers shun the door.", "Business, you know, may bring you money, but friendship hardly ever does.", "The price we have to pay for money is sometimes liberty.", "Many of the things you can count, don't count. Many of the things you can't count, really count.", "Money doesn't always bring happiness. A man with ten million dollars is no happier than a man with nine million dollars.", "Don't ever let economic alone determine your career or how you spend the majority of your time.", "The universal regard for money is the one hopeful fact in our civilization. Money is the most important thing in the world. It represents health, strength, honor, generosity and beauty. Not the least of its virtues is that it destroys base people as certainly as it fortifies and dignifies noble people.", "If a person gets his attitude toward money straight, it will help straighten out almost every other area in his life.", "Money, it turned out, was exactly like sex, you thought of nothing else if you didn't have it and thought of other things if you did.", "Money is the representative of a certain quantity of corn or other commodity. It is so much warmth, so much bread.", "Lack of money is the root of all evil.", "If you're going to lend money make sure somebody else is around. If you're going to give money make sure nobody else is around.", "There is nothing so habit-forming as money.", "The safest way to double your money is to fold over once and put it in your pocket.", "Money won't make you happy... but everybody wants to find out for themselves."]

Men were weighed by their dollars, measures were gauged by their dollars; life was auctioned, appraised, put up, and knocked down for its dollars. The next respectable thing to dollars was any venture having their attainment for its end. The more of that worthless ballast, honor and fair-dealing, which any man cast overboard from the ship of his Good Nature and Good Intent, the more ample stowage-room he had for dollars.

Men can employ it as a tool or they can dance around it as if it were the incarnation of a god.

It acquires its meaning from the uses to which it is put.", "The love of money grows as the money itself grows.", "If you are poor, though you dwell in the busy marketplace, no one will inquire about you; if you are rich, though you dwell in the heart of the mountains, you will have distant relatives.", "It doesn't matter whether you are rich or poor -- as long as you've got money.", "I don't like money actually, but it quiets the nerves.", "God makes, and apparel shapes; but it's money that finishes the man.", "Money begets money.", "Where gold speaks every tongue is silent.", "Money is a singular thing.

Many of the things you can't count, really count.", "Money doesn't always bring happiness. A man with ten million dollars is no happier than a man with nine million dollars.", "Don't ever let economic alone determine your career or how you spend the majority of your time.", "The universal regard for money is the one hopeful fact in our civilization. Money is the most important thing in the world. It represents health, strength, honor, generosity and beauty. Not the least of its virtues is that it destroys base people as certainly as it fortifies and dignifies noble people.", "If a person gets his attitude toward money straight, it will help straighten out almost every other area in his life.", "Money, it turned out, was exactly like sex, you thought of nothing else if you didn't have it and thought of other things if you did.", "Money is the representative of a certain quantity of corn or other commodity. It is so much warmth, so much bread.", "Lack of money is the root of all evil.", "If you're going to lend money make sure somebody else is around.

History furnishes one example only of a first magistrate being formally brought to public justice. Every body cried out against this as unconstitutional. What was the practice before this, in cases where the chief magistrate rendered himself obnoxious? Why, recourse was had to assassination, in which he was not only deprived of his life, but of the opportunity of vindicating his character.

Roosevelt urging that research be funded for an atomic bomb on the grounds that the United States had to possess the weapon before Germany.", "This recommendation marked the beginning of the Manhattan Project for the construction of the world's first nuclear weapons, although it was such scientists as Fermi rather than Einstein himself (considered a security risk, in spite of  becoming a U.S. citizen in 1940) who led and participated in the project.", "After World War II and the bombing of Japan, Einstein became an ardent supporter of nuclear disarmament, while also campaigning for the establishment of a world government and of an independent Jewish state.", "The first was the explanation of an anomaly in the orbit of the planet Mercury (that its perihelion, or point of orbit closest to the Sun, advanced slightly more than was predicted by Newton's laws) that could not be explained by Newtonian mechanics.", "The second was that a red shift (i.e. to a longer wavelength) is produced if light passes through an intense gravitational field (this was subsequently detected in astronomical observations by the English astronomer Arthur Eddington in 1924).", "He also found that in a system in motion relative to an observer,  not only would length be observed to decrease, but time would slow and mass would increase.", "Einstein's theory was revolutionary because previously scientists had believed that basic quantities of measurement such as time, mass, and length were absolute and unchanging, while his work established the opposite notion - that these measurements could change, depending on the relative motion of the observer.", "In 1913, Einstein was made director of scientific research at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin and given a chair in physics  at the University of Berlin, where he became the colleague of, among others, Planck, Nernst, and later Schrodinger.", "In order to solve this problem, Einstein - using the quantum hypothesis (1900) of the German physicist Planck - postulated that light travels in tiny discrete bundles, or individual \"quanta\" of energy (later called photons), the energy of which is a function of its wavelength.", "He influenced Heaviside, and Wiener.", "He was influenced by Helmholtz.", "A precursor was JJ Thomson.", "In this work, Einstein showed that Newton's theory of gravitation is in fact a close approximation of his more exact general theory of relativity, but relegated it to a special case, only useful at relatively slow speeds.", "Einstein instead postulated that gravitation is not a force, as Newton had believed, but a curved field in the space-time continuum, created by the presence of mass, replacing Newton's theory of gravitational attraction between bodies by a space-time mathematical description in which bodies influence the characteristics of space in their vicinity.", "In addition to his continued work on the unified field theory, he was continually in demand as a speaker and during the 1930s he wrote extensively on many topics, especially peace.", "In 1939 he was informed by Niels Bohr that at Copenhagen the German refugee physicist Lise Meitner had split the uranium atom in experiments that had been inspired by similar, though less precise, experiments done months earlier in Berlin by two German chemists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann.", "He met Eisenstein.", "He knew Rutherford.", "Wrote anti-war letter with Russell.", "As a result, Einstein concluded that no system can move at a velocity equal to or greater than the velocity of light.", "Einstein's conclusions regarding time dilation and mass increase were later verified with observations of fast-moving subatomic particles and cosmic rays, and no velocity greater than the speed of light has ever been detected.", "It had also proved impossible to measure the expected changes in the speed of light relative to the motion of the Earth, and in 1881 and 1887 the Michelson-Morley experiment had proved conclusively there was no 'ether,'  and  that the velocity of light does not vary with the motion of either the source or the observer.", "To account for  this, the Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald, and the Dutch physicist Lorentz independently suggested that all lengths (of the stands,  for example,  holding the mirrors reflecting the light beam whose velocity through the 'ether' was being measured) contract in the direction of motion (the 'FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction'),  and had developed a mathematical formula to  describe the effect of motion on various types of measurement.", "One of his early followers was Laue.", "The first of these (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Demanded by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\") dealt with a phenomenon first observed by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown in 1827, who reported that tiny particles, such as pollen grains, moved about with a rapid and random zigzag motion when suspended in liquid, and that the motion of the particles increased when the temperature increased, but that the motion decreased if larger particles were used.", "In addition to these three great achievements, Einstein wrote two more papers in 1905, one being his doctoral dissertation, and the other titled: \"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend on Its Energy Content?\" which again dealt with relativity and came to the conclusion that the energy and mass of a body are closely interrelated.", "Two years later, in 1907, he went on to show that mass is related to energy by the famous equation E=mc2 (energy equals mass times the speed of light squared), which indicates the enormous amount of energy that is stored as mass, some of which is released in radioactivity and nuclear reactions.", "Despite these achievements, when Einstein submitted his paper on relativity to the University of Berne in 1905 in support of his application to become a Privatdozent (unsalaried junior lecturer), his application was rejected and he continued at the Patent Office for another three years.", "So when light falls on a metal, electrons in the metal absorb specific quanta of energy, giving them enough energy to escape from the surface of the metal,  with the number of electrons released determined not by the number of quanta (i.e. the intensity) of the light, but by its energy (i.e. its wavelength).", "The same year,  in 'The Annals of Physics'  Einstein published three papers (on Brownian motion, the photoelectric effect, and special relativity) that not only established his genius as a theoretical physicist, but also changed both the face of physics and humanity's view of the universe.", "Einstein hypothesized that the visible motion of the particles was caused by the random movement of molecules that made up the liquid, and derived a mathematical formula that predicted the distance travelled by particles and their relative speed, from which the number of molecules of liquid per unit volume could be inferred.", "Einstein's work on Brownian motion is generally regarded as the first direct experimental evidence for the hypothesis that matter is composed of atoms and molecules.", "In 1908 his second application to Berne was accepted.", "He discovered the basic laser principle He was a friend of Lindemann.", "Einstein was triumphantly vindicated when observations of a solar eclipse in 1919 showed apparent shifts of exactly the amount he had predicted, and once this result was reported throughout the world Einstein became internationally famous, and relativity a household word.", "Einstein's publication of his \"Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity\" essentially brought to a close the revolutionary period of his scientific career.", "With the rise of National Socialism in Germany, Einstein's position as both a Jew and a pacifist became increasingly difficult, and with Hitler's rise to power in 1933 he accepted an appointment at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey, where he spent the rest of his life.", "During the 1920s, a period when Germany's political situation was deteriorating rapidly and anti-Semitism was on the rise, he instead became involved in anti-nationalist and pacifist causes, and began publicly to support the Zionist movement - all of which made him highly unpopular with Germany's growing right wing.", "He met composer Britten.", "In particular, he found it impossible to accept Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, central to quantum mechanics, which states that the movement of a single particle could not be predicted because of a fundamental uncertainty in measuring simultaneously both its speed and its position (which meant, in effect, that the future of any physical system at the subatomic level cannot be predicted).", "Believing in a God and an exactly engineered universe, at the Solvay Conference of 1927 on quantum theory attended by Planck, Bohr, de Broglie, Heisenberg, Schrodinger and Dirac among others - Einstein alienated many of his  colleagues by claiming that quantum mechanics, which could only calculate the probabilities of physical events, although brilliant could not be absolutely correct because \"God does not play dice\" with the universe.", "Instead, much to the dismay of the majority of his fellow scientists (in particular his close friend the German quantum theorist Born), Einstein devoted the remaining years of his life to the search for a unified field theory, a single mathematical theory that would encompass all physical fields, particularly gravitation and electromagnetism.", "In 1902, Einstein got a junior-level appointment at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, working as an appraiser for new electrical machines,  and studying in his spare time for a doctorate from the University of Zurich,  which he achieved in 1905 for a paper titled:  \"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\".", "During the war years, Einstein became an outspoken opponent of German militarism, but remained primarily engaged in perfecting the extension of his 1905 theory of relativity to a broader context, by considering systems that are not in uniform motion but under acceleration.", "Now attempting to encompass all kinds of motion and accelerations (varying velocities), Einstein

of relativity, gravitation must be taken into account.", "He was painted by Rothenstein.", "Einstein's second paper (\"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\") dealt with the photoelectric effect.", "First observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1888, the photoelectric effect involves the release of electrons from a metal that occurs when light is shone on the metal, the number of electrons released being a function not of the light's intensity (as one might expect) but of the color (i.e. the wavelength) of the light.", "The third test was Einstein's prediction that the apparent positions of stars would shift when they are seen near the Sun, because the Sun's intense gravity would bend the light rays from the stars as they pass the Sun (this starlight being visible only during a total eclipse).", "The magnitude of these effects is negligible at ordinary velocities, for which Newton's laws still held good, but at velocities approaching the speed of light they become significant.", "If a system were to move at the velocity of light, to an observer its length would be zero, time would be at a stop, and its mass would be infinite.", "In 1895 Einstein failed the  entrance examination for the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  in Zurich, one of Europe's finest institutions for higher learning in science, where he had planned to major in electrical engineering.", "As a result he enrolled for a year at a Swiss cantonal high school.", "In 1952, after the death of Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, Einstein was invited to succeed

But if their ostentation does exceed their fortune they will ruin themselves. In such a country, the greatest fortunes will vanish in the twinkling of an eye.

The next respectable thing to dollars was any venture having their attainment for its end. The more of that worthless ballast, honor and fair-dealing, which any man cast overboard from the ship of his Good Nature and Good Intent, the more ample stowage-room he had for dollars.

Men can employ it as a tool or they can dance around it as if it were the incarnation of a god.

Money is the most important thing in the world. It represents health, strength, honor, generosity and beauty.

what is james madison most famous for?	["President of the United States"]	["The free system of government we have established is so congenial with reason, with common sense, and with a universal feeling, that it must produce approbation and a desire of imitation, as avenues may be found for truth to the knowledge of nations.", "Learned Institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty & dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.", "It is my good fortune, moreover, to have the path in which I am to tread lighted by examples of illustrious services successfully rendered in the most trying difficulties by those who have marched before me.", "War contains so much folly, as well as wickedness, that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason; and if any thing is to be hoped, every thing ought to be tried.", "A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.", "Learned Institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty and dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.", "Since the general civilization of mankind, I believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people, by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power, than by violent and sudden usurpations.", "It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be to-morrow.", "I think it absolutely necessary that the President should have the power of removing [his subordinates] from office; it will make him, in a peculiar manner, responsible for their conduct, and subject him to impeachment himself, if he suffers them to perpetrate with impunity high crimes or misdemeanors against the United States, or neglects to superintend their conduct, so as to check their excesses.", "The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, & most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the Legislature. But the Doctrines lately advanced strike at the root of all these provisions, and will deposit the peace of the Country in that Department which the Constitution distrusts as most ready without cause to renounce it. For if the opinion of the President not the facts & proofs themselves are to sway the judgment of Congress, in declaring war, and if the President in the recess of Congress create a foreign mission, appoint the minister, & negociate a War Treaty, without the possibility of a check even from the Senate, untill the measures present alternatives overruling the freedom of its judgment; if again a Treaty when made obliges the Legislature to declare war contrary to its judgment, and in pursuance of the same doctrine, a law declaring war, imposes a like moral obligation, to grant the requisite supplies until it be formally repealed with the consent of the President & Senate, it is evident that the people are cheated out of the best ingredients in their Government, the safeguards of peace which is the greatest of their blessings.", "The happy Union of these States is a wonder; their Constitution a miracle; their example the hope of Liberty throughout the world.", "The genius of Republican liberty, seems to demand on one side, not only that all power should be derived from the people; but, that those entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people, by a short duration of their appointments; and, that, even during this short period, the trust should be placed not in a few, but in a number of hands. Stability, on the contrary, requires, that the hands, in which power is lodged, should continue for a length of time, the same. A frequent change of men will result from a frequent return of electors, and a frequent change of measures, from a frequent change of men; whilst energy in Government requires not only a certain duration of power, but the execution of it by a single hand.", "The danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by interesting too strongly the public passions, is a still more serious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional questions to the decision of the whole society.", "To the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.", "The essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.", "The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.", "In order to judge of the form to be given to this institution [the Senate], it will be proper to take a view of the ends to be served by it. These were,first, to protect the people against their rulers, secondly, to protect the people against the transient impressions into which they themselves might be led.", "...the aids which alone can supply my deficiencies is in the well-tried intelligence and virtue of my fellow-citizens...", "What spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable, than that of Liberty & Learning, each leaning on the other for their mutual & surest support?", "The safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions aim, and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed.", "..to support the Constitution, which is the cement of the Union, as well in its limitations as in its authorities;", "About to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligations imposed by a second call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me, I find in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of publicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confidence and of the responsibility united with it.", "And as it [the federal district] is to be appropriated to this use with the consent of the State ceding it; as the State will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights, and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the election of the Government which is to exercise authority over them; as a municipal Legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the authority of the Legislature of the State, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it, to concur in the cession, will be derived from the whole people of the State, in their adoption of the Constitution, every imaginable objection seems to be obviated.", "What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.", "Liberty may be endangered by the abuse of liberty, but also by the abuse of power.", "We are right to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties.", "Is it not the glory of the people of America, that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own situation, and the lessons of their own experience? To this manly spirit, posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the world for the example, of the numerous innovations displayed on the American theatre, in favor of private rights and public happiness.", "As the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects, we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honor, no usage of civilized nations, no precept of courtesy or humanity, have been infringed.", "The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.", "If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.", "The proposed Constitution is, in strictness, neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both.", "To cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations having correspondent dispositions; to maintain sincere neutrality toward belligerent nations; to prefer in all cases amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an appeal to arms....", "As a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.", "Equal laws protecting equal rights the best guarantee of loyalty & love of country."]

including the assumption of state debts, the Bank of the United States, and the excise tax  -  during the early 1790s Washington became the target of vicious personal attacks by Jefferson's supporters.", "Washington was re-elected president in 1792, and the following year a major crisis occurred in his cabinet over the issue of American neutrality during the war between England and France.", "Washington, whose policy of neutrality angered the pro-French Jeffersonians, was horrified by the excesses of the French Revolution and enraged by the tactics of Edmond Genet, the French minister in the United States, which amounted to foreign interference in American politics.", "Noah Webster was a supporter.", "Lawrence failed to recover and died on his return home in 1752.", "Soon afterwards Washington leased the Mount Vernon estate from Lawrence's widow, and by 1761 had acquired the property outright.", "Meanwhile, with Lawrence's death Virginia's colonial governor Robert Dinwiddie appointed Washington adjutant commander of one of Virginia's four militia districts with the rank of major.", "Friend of politician Gouverneur Morris.", "He ordered Paine's pamphlet to be read to the troops at Valley Forge.", "Endowed Washington College.", "Meanwhile, the major success of that year, the defeat in October 1777 of the British at Saratoga, had belonged not to Washington but to Benedict Arnold and General Horatio Gates.", "The contrast between Washington's record and Gates's brilliant victory was one factor that led to the so-called \"Conway Cabal\" -

written to a younger brother, but subsequently published all over America - made him a hero of English-speaking America.", "As full-scale war between Britain and France became inevitable, Washington was eager to participate, but when he learned that the British government had ordered that colonials could hold a rank no higher than captain, he resigned his commission at the end of 1754.", "The following year, however, he joined British general Edward Braddock's expedition against the French as a volunteer.", "Early in March 1776, using cannon brought down from Ticonderoga by Henry Knox, Washington occupied Dorchester Heights, effectively commanding the city and forcing the British to evacuate.", "He then moved to defend New York City against the combined land and sea forces of Sir William Howe, but eventually retreated from Manhattan through New Jersey into Pennsylvania.", "After the war, Washington returned to Mount Vernon, which had declined in his absence.", "In 1789, after the new Constitution was submitted to the states for ratification, he was unanimously elected President and agreed to serve.", "He took the oath administered by Livingston on 30th April 1789 in New York City, at the age of 57.", "On taking office, Washington was immediately faced with filling almost a thousand offices, the most important going to Jay (chief justice), Jefferson (Secretary of State), Alexander Hamilton (Secretary of the Treasury), Henry Knox (Secretary of War), Edmund Randolph (attorney general), and Samuel Osgood (postmaster general).", "During his first term of office, Washington generally acted carefully and deliberately as President (as he had as military commander), aware of the need to build an firm foundation and executive structure that could accommodate future governments and presidents.", "With an eye to developing closer commercial ties with the British, the president agreed with the Hamiltonians on the need for peace with Great Britain.", "His acceptance of Jay's Treaty (1795), which settled outstanding differences between the United States and Britain (but which Democratic- Republicans viewed as a surrender to British demands), revived attacks on the President.", "By March 1797, when Washington left office, the country's financial system was well established, the American Indian threat east of the Mississippi had been largely eliminated, and both Jay's and Pinckney's Treaty (1795) with Spain had enlarged U.S. territory and removed serious diplomatic difficulties.", "Aaron Burr was his aide.", "Andrew Jackson voted against tributes on his retirement.", "Robert E.

on the Delaware River,  and the French and the Native Americans attacked Pennsylvania's frontiers.", "In 1757, he was sent to England to present the Philadelphia side in the controversy with the \"Pennsylvania Proprietors\" (the Penn family).", "The need for funds to defend the frontier had led the legislature to try to tax the lands of the Penn family, who were the proprietors under the

like charged bodies, and that pointed conductors could dissipate the charge or carry it safely to earth.", "In 1745, Peter Collinson in London sent a pamphlet describing new German investigations into electricity.", "Franklin repeated the experiments in the pamphlet, most of them having to do with the Leyden jar (an early capacitor invented in Leyden, Holland, in the mid-1740s).", "His research

Volta,  and Petrus van Musschenbroek.", "Author Bigelow edited his autobiography.", "In 1730, he bought the weekly newspaper \"The Pennsylvania Gazette\" which became acknowledged as one of the best colonial newspapers.", "He concluded that when objects were electrified, nothing new was created or lost, but that the electricity was rearranged (conservation of charge).", "In 1723, he moved to Philadelphia, where the governor of Pennsylvania, Sir William Keith, lent him money to set up his own print shop.", "He also arranged for Franklin to go to England to contact London paper-sellers, but
