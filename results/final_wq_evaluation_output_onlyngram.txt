what discovery did galileo make?	["Ganymede", "Callisto", "Europa", "Galilean moons", "Io"]	["In his defence, Galileo wrote two letters for publication, one to his pupil Castelli and the other to the Dowager Duchess Christina (both 1615), in which he argued that neither the Bible nor nature could speak falsely and that whereas the investigation of nature was the province of the scientist, the reconciliation of scientific facts with the language of the Bible was that of the theologian.", "With the special indulgence with which he was treated throughout the trial,  this was commuted to house arrest on his small estate (provided by his ex-pupil Ferdinand II of Tuscany at Arcetri near Florence, where he returned in December 1633. This sentence of house arrest remained in effect throughout the last eight years of Galileo's life. During these last years, Galileo continued his research, even after his hearing and sight began to fail.   In 1634 he completed his 'Discorsi e dimostrazioni mathematiche intorno a due nuove scienze attenenti alla meccanica' ('Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences'), which was smuggled out of Italy and published at Leiden in 1638,  and inspired much experimental work by such scientists as Torricelli,  Berti and Ricci Galileo's last telescopic discovery - that of the Moon's diurnal and monthly librations (wobbling from side to side) - was made in 1637, only a few months before he became blind.", "Once he was totally blind (1638), Galileo was permitted to have his two friends, the geometrician Viviani and Torricelli, to live with him, to whom he was dictating his latest ideas on the theory of impact when he was seized with the slow fever that resulted in his death.", "In 1591 on his father's death he resigned from  Pisa and returned to Florence.", "He also composed an untitled treatise on motion, now generally referred to as 'De motu', which disproved the Aristotelian theory that bodies of different weights fall at different speeds, and instead developed a theory of falling bodies derived from the buoyancy principle of Archimedes, an idea previously published by Benedetti .", "The following year his patron succeeded in getting him the chair of mathematics at the University of Padua, where he was to remain for the next 18 years (1592-1610),  attracting pupils from all over Europe to his lectures.", "While working on this, he was sent a short treatise on sunspots by the Jesuit Scheiner whose ideas - in particular the idea that the spots were tiny planets - Galileo demolished in three long letters, published in 1613 as 'Letters on Sunspots'.", "The 'Letters' also confirmed Galileo's earlier criticism of Aristotelian cosmology, as he maintained that the movement of the spots across the face of the Sun proved that Copernicus' system was correct,  and also that the Sun rotated.", "Having now spoken out publicly and decisively for the Copernican system Galileo faced increasing attacks from church authorities because of contradictions between the Copernican theory and the Scriptures, and in 1614 he was reported to the Inquisition.", "His work related to that of  Oresme, Buridan William of Ockham, Al Battani, Cortona,  Tartaglia, Roberval, Boyle,  Milton,   Mersenne, Gassendi, and Peiresc.", "It is not clear whether this trip precipitated the ultimate crisis, but in March 1616 a committee of consultors to the Holy Office declared that the proposition that the Sun is the immovable centre of the universe was heretical, and that the proposition of a moving Earth was theologically \"erroneous\".", "The Holy Office then told its leading Roman theologian, Bellarmine,  to ask Galileo to abandon \"realist\" Copernicanism, which was declared \"false and erroneous\", and Copernicus': 'De Revolutionibus' was put on the list of prohibited books.", "Galileo spent the next seven years (1616-23) in retirement at his house in Bellosguardo near Florence, in 1618-23 becoming involved in a dispute with Orazio Grassi over the nature of comets, which ended with the publication of his famous work, 'Il Saggiatore' ('The Assayer'), a brilliant piece on physical reality,  and an exposition of the new scientific method which included his famous pronouncement that the \"Book of Nature is... written in mathematical characters\".", "Praised work of Gilbert.", "He advised Christiaan Huyghens to patent his clock He was influenced by Witelo and the Council of Trent Venturi wrote about him His astronomy was followed up by  Borelli.", "He was later corrected by Fermat.", "During his time in Padua, he took a Venetian mistress, Marina Gamba, by whom between 1600 and 1606 he had two daughters and a son.", "He also corresponded with the Italian physician Santorio and the Italian physicist Baliani.", "In July 1609, while visiting Venice, Galileo learned of the recent invention of the telescope by the Dutch lens-grinder Lippershey in 1608, and on his return to Padua built one.", "On his return, Galileo turned again to physics, and published a book on the behaviour of bodies placed in water: 'Discourses on Things that Float' (1612).", "During these years he became convinced of the truth of the Copernicus' theory (that the planets revolve about the Sun) but was deterred from going public - as shown in his letter of 4 April 1597 to Kepler -   because of fear of the church (the Italian philosopher, Bruno had been arrested in 1592 and would in 1600 be burned at the stake for defending Copernicus. At Padua,  the leading scientific centre of the day, Galileo continued his research on motion, and around 1604 proved theoretically that falling bodies obey what came to be known as the law of uniformly accelerated motion (a body speeds up or slows down uniformly with time).", "Over the next few months he continued to work on the telescope, and by the end of 1609 he had improved it to a power of thirty-two, the practicable limit for a refracting telescope of this type, in which a convex (converging) objective lens and a concave (diverging) lens in the eyepiece together produce a magnified, upright image.", "Galileo then returned to Florence and spent the next several years working on his great book, 'Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo, tolemaico e copernicano' ('Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems - Ptolemaic and Copernican'), which he completed in 1630 and was permitted to publish in 1632.", "Inevitably, after a comparison of these two systems, Galileo came down heavily on the side of Copernicanism, and Urban VIII, feeling he had been tricked, summoned the old scientist to Rome in February 1633.", "No action was taken, but Galileo was alarmed enough by the news from Rome to decide in December 1615 to present his views there himself.", "In the summer of 1610 Galileo resigned from Padua, and returned to Florence as mathematician and philosopher to Cosimo II, with no teaching duties and a large salary.", "In Florence he continued his astronomical observations, and discovered spots on the surface of the Sun's disc, the oval appearance of Saturn, and that the planet Venus has crescent phases like the moon.", "Brewster wrote his biography He met Campanella.", "The Cassini family improved on his measurements His problems influenced Descartes, Hobbes,  Mariotte and Newton.", "Perhaps the most far-reaching of his achievements was his insistence that the \"Book of Nature is . . . written in mathematical characters\".", "From this base, he was able to found the modern experimental method.", "From 1585 to 1589 Galileo gave lessons in mathematics in Florence and Siena, and in 1586 he published an essay (describing his invention of a hydrostatic balance) which made him known throughout Italy, and won him the support of a wealthy patron, the Marchese del Monte, for whom he wrote a treatise on the centre of gravity in solids (1588) and who got him the job of lecturer in mathematics at the University of Pisa.", "In Pisa, Galileo began a controversial campaign to discredit accepted Aristotelian physics.", "From April to June 1633 Galileo was tried before the Holy Office and was found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", forced to abjure Copernicanism publicly, and sentenced to imprisonment.", "Late in August, Galileo arrived back in Venice with a nine-power telescope, three times as effective as those from Holland.", "In particular, Galileo saw in the moons of Jupiter a miniature planetary system,  thanks to which it could no longer be argued (as critics of Copernicus did)  that all moving heavenly bodies revolved exclusively around the Earth, Within two years he had constructed approximately accurate tables of the orbits of Jupiter's moons and suggested their frequent eclipses as a means of calculating longitude.", "Early in 1611 Galileo travelled to Rome, where he spent several months demonstrating his discoveries,  and winning the approval of the Jesuits of the Roman College, the pope and several cardinals.", "In 1624 Galileo returned to Rome, to visit the new pope, Urban VIII, who had been a longtime friend (and to whom he had dedicated 'Il Saggiatore') and got permission to write about \"the systems of the world\", both of Ptolemy and Copernicus, as long as he discussed them noncommittally and came to the conclusion dictated to him in advance by the pope - i.e. that humans cannot presume to know how the world is really made,  because God could have brought about the same observable effects in ways unimagined by them."]

This channel was described in the logbooks of a voyage made in 1602 by another English explorer, Captain George Weymouth, who had described an inlet (now called Hudson Strait) where water rushed out with every ebb tide,  suggesting a body of water lying beyond the strait (and which Hudson believed to be the Pacific Ocean).", "Now an established explorer, Hudson found willing backers for his plans.", "On 17 April 1610 Hudson sailed from London in a new ship, the 55-ton 'Discovery' with a crew of 20, first to Iceland, then sailing along the coast of Greenland to the Davis Strait, as an ice-free sea was believed to lie in the polar regions at its northern exit.", "Strong tides swept his ship south round Resolution Island and, in July, westwards into Hudson Strait, an area well known to adventurers but unexplored because of its treacherous tides and ice packs.", "Although the crew mutinied at this point, Hudson managed to persuade them to continue, and for six weeks he forced his way through the strait.", "On 3 August he entered the vast inland sea now known as Hudson's Bay, and thought that he had reached the Pacific.", "Hudson then sailed south, following the eastern shore of the bay until in October the ship reached James Bay at the southernmost extremity.", "He spent the following weeks cruising unsuccessfully in search of a passage to the Pacific until the Arctic winter overtook the ship, while his crew became increasingly unhappy.", "In September Hudson was accused of distributing the food unfairly.", "Finally, the ship broke free of the ice in early June, and on 12 June 1611 they began their homeward voyage, with almost no food.", "Twelve days later a mutiny broke out, and Hudson, his son John, and seven others were set adrift in a small open boat, with no supplies.", "Nothing was ever heard of them again.", "Hudson's Bay Co named after him.", "Wren was a Company Director He was supported by the Earl of Southampton.", "The ship reached the coast of Greenland in June but, failing to find a passage northwards through the polar ice pack, Hudson then sailed east along its edge and on 27 June he reached the Svalbard (Spitsbergen) archipelago,  where he was again stopped by the ice, and although he tried to force his way eastwards through the ice fields, his efforts proved fruitless, and on 15 September he turned and headed for home.", "On his return voyage, he accidentally discovered Jan Mayen Island, which he named Hudson's Touches, and brought back to England information which opened up the profitable whale fisheries in Spitsbergen to the English.", "In April 1608, Hudson set sail on a second voyage of exploration for the Muscovy Company, this time to seek the Northeast Passage between Spitsbergen and the islands of Novaya Zemlya, which lie to the east of the Barents Sea.", "However, he again found his way blocked by ice fields, and within four months he was back in England.", "These two failures appear to have discouraged the Muscovy Company from financing further expeditions, and Hudson was forced to look elsewhere for investors.", "During the winter of 1608-09 he successfully negotiated a contract with the Amsterdam Chamber of the Dutch East India Company to search north of Novaya Zemlya for a northeast passage to the East."]

what kind of equipment did isaac newton use?	["Reflecting telescope"]	["Between 1665 and 1667, Newton made revolutionary advances in optics, physics, and astronomy, and laid the foundations for differential and integral calculus, several years before Leibniz's  discoveries.", "The \"method of fluxions\", as he called it,  produced simple analytical methods that unified many existing techniques so as to solve problems like finding areas, tangents, the lengths of curves, and the maximums and minimums of functions.", "Also at this time, Newton began to think about gravity.", "He also was fascinated by the mechanics of Copernican astronomy as set out by Galileo and by Kepler's \"Optics\".", "In the simple case of circular orbit, the law of attraction followed from Kepler's Third Law (relating the times of revolution of the planets around the sun to the sizes of their orbits) together with Huyghens's 1673 expression for the centripetal acceleration of a body moving in a circle.", "The inverse problem of calculating the orbit from the law of force (which had baffled Hooke, Wren , Halley and others) was solved by Newton around 1680.", "Soon after, he also found the missing link in the identification of the force of terrestrial gravity by discovering that a spherically-symmetrical distribution of matter exerts the same attraction at external points as if its mass were concentrated at its center.", "Erasmus Bartholin's work questioned Newton's work on optics.", "He admired the work of Oughtred.", "During his third year at Cambridge, Newton went beyond the compulsory study of Aristotle and read the works of Descartes , Gassendi , Hobbes , and 17th-century chemist Boyle .", "His work related to that of Algarotti, Gregory, Stevin,  'sGravesende  Haukesbee, Wallis, Johann Bernoulli, Stevin, Cavendish, Ferrel, Copernicus, Peiresc and William of Ockham.", "Late in 1679, Hooke wrote to Newton describing his analysis of planetary motion.", "This led to an exchange between the two on the subject of elliptical orbits.", "The idea of a law of attraction according to the inverse square of the distance between the sun and the planets was now a topic of wide discussion in scientific circles.", "In a discussion of the shape of the orbit under the inverse square law of attraction towards a fixed center, Newton suggested the shape would be an ellipse, and promised to send Halley the calculation from which he had calculated the answer.", "Three months later, Halley received a short tract, (\"On Motion\") which at Halley's request was registered with the Royal Society in early 1685.", "This tract, which over the next two years Newton expanded, formed the basis of the first book of \"Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica\" (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\") or the \"Principia\", as it commonly known.", "It was acknowledged that though Leibniz's discoveries were later in time, he preceded Newton in publishing a full account.", "Newton was given a state funeral and was buried in Westminster Abbey.", "Voltaire remarked that England had honored a mathematician as other nations had honored a king.", "Now obliged to deliver an annual course of lectures, Newton chose optics as his first subject.", "Over the next three years he summarized his findings in an essay, \"Of Colours\", which  became Book One of his \"Opticks\",  published in 1704.", "Newton knew or worked with Tillotson, Sprat, Leeuwenhoek, Grew, Sloane and Arbuthnot.", "In 1672, Newton published an account of his findings on white light in the Royal Society's \"Philosophical Transactions\".", "The paper provoked skepticism from the curator of the Royal Society, Hooke , and, on the Continent, from Christiaan Huyghens .", "Both objected to Newton's attempt to prove by experiment alone that light consisted of the motion of small particles.", "Newton influenced Cheselden, Dalton, De Moivre, Maupertius, Buffon, Winthrop, Hales, Pieter van Musschenbroek and Whiston.", "In 1669, Barrow decided the world must know about Newton's mathematical achievements and sent Newton's preliminary work, \"On Analysis by Infinite Series,\"  to John Collins in London.", "He also said he thought light consisted of the motion of small particles, rather than waves.", "Barrow then resigned his Lucasian Professor's chair to make way for Newton.", "He wondered whether the force that pulled an apple to the ground could also pull the Moon into an orbit around the Earth.", "From 1664, he recorded his thoughts in a notebook he called \"Certain Philosophical Questions\".", "He studied higher mathematics under Professor Isaac Barrow , who recognized Newton's genius and encouraged him.", "He assumed that the rate of fall is proportional to the force of gravity and that this force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the Earth.", "He then worked out what the motion of the Moon would be if these assumptions were correct, but obtained a figure that was too low.", "Disappointed, he set aside his figures and did not return to them until about 12 years later.", "Newton turned his attention to the nature of light.", "Contemporary scientists believed that white light was a basic single entity, but the chromatic aberration seen in a telescope lens convinced Newton otherwise.", "Passing a beam of sunlight through a prism, he observed that the beam spread into a colored band of light (spectrum), and from this he argued that sunlight is really a combination of all the colors.", "In 1675, when Newton published another paper on the color phenomena in thin films, he annoyed Hooke again, this time because Hooke thought Newton had stolen some of his own optical results.", "In this paper, Newton demonstrated the existence of periodic optical phenomena: he had discovered concentric colored rings in the thin film of air between a lens and a flat sheet of glass and calculated that the distance between these concentric rings (\"Newton's rings\") depended on the thickness of the film of air.", "In the summer of 1684, Halley visited Newton at Cambridge to discuss orbital dynamics.", "With Halley's help, the \"Principia\" was published in 1687 and hailed as a masterpiece.", "The \"Principia\" contained Newton's three laws of motion (now known as Newton's Laws: laws of inertia, action and reaction, and acceleration proportional to force),  his theory of tides and lunar motion,  and his theory of gravitation as a universal law of attraction between any two objects.", "His gravitational law declared that the force of gravity is proportional to the masses of the objects and decreases in proportion to the square of the distance between two bodies.", "His laws of motion laid the basis for classical mechanics.", "His theory of gravity was particularly important in working out the motions of the planets.", "By their application, Newton formulated the universal laws of nature with which he was able to solve virtually all the unsolved problems of his day.", "In 1689, Newton campaigned for a seat in Parliament and became Member for Cambridge.", "While in London, he met famous diarists Evelyn and Pepys and philosopher Locke .", "However, in 1692, the strain of his studies and his scientific disputes, especially with Leibniz, Flamsteed and Hooke, cast him into a severe depression and rumors spread that he had gone mad.", "In 1696, he was appointed Warden of the London Mint, becoming Master of the Mint in 1699.", "In 1703, he was elected President of the Royal Society, an office he held until his death.", "In 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne.", "A constant preoccupation for Newton was the continuing fight with Leibniz over who first invented calculus.", "A Royal Society panel, including Halley and mathematician William Jones ,  decided that Newton was the first to unify and make explicit what had been latent in the work of various forerunners.", "\"Principia\" was translated into French by du Chatelet in 1759.", "The physicist Brewster wrote his biography.", "He met Romer.", "One of the greatest scientists of all time."]
