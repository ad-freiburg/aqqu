what discovery did galileo make?	["Ganymede", "Callisto", "Europa", "Galilean moons", "Io"]	["In his defence, Galileo wrote two letters for publication, one to his pupil Castelli and the other to the Dowager Duchess Christina (both 1615), in which he argued that neither the Bible nor nature could speak falsely and that whereas the investigation of nature was the province of the scientist, the reconciliation of scientific facts with the language of the Bible was that of the theologian.", "With the special indulgence with which he was treated throughout the trial,  this was commuted to house arrest on his small estate (provided by his ex-pupil Ferdinand II of Tuscany at Arcetri near Florence, where he returned in December 1633. This sentence of house arrest remained in effect throughout the last eight years of Galileo's life. During these last years, Galileo continued his research, even after his hearing and sight began to fail.   In 1634 he completed his 'Discorsi e dimostrazioni mathematiche intorno a due nuove scienze attenenti alla meccanica' ('Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences'), which was smuggled out of Italy and published at Leiden in 1638,  and inspired much experimental work by such scientists as Torricelli,  Berti and Ricci Galileo's last telescopic discovery - that of the Moon's diurnal and monthly librations (wobbling from side to side) - was made in 1637, only a few months before he became blind.", "Once he was totally blind (1638), Galileo was permitted to have his two friends, the geometrician Viviani and Torricelli, to live with him, to whom he was dictating his latest ideas on the theory of impact when he was seized with the slow fever that resulted in his death.", "In 1591 on his father's death he resigned from  Pisa and returned to Florence.", "He also composed an untitled treatise on motion, now generally referred to as 'De motu', which disproved the Aristotelian theory that bodies of different weights fall at different speeds, and instead developed a theory of falling bodies derived from the buoyancy principle of Archimedes, an idea previously published by Benedetti .", "The following year his patron succeeded in getting him the chair of mathematics at the University of Padua, where he was to remain for the next 18 years (1592-1610),  attracting pupils from all over Europe to his lectures.", "While working on this, he was sent a short treatise on sunspots by the Jesuit Scheiner whose ideas - in particular the idea that the spots were tiny planets - Galileo demolished in three long letters, published in 1613 as 'Letters on Sunspots'.", "The 'Letters' also confirmed Galileo's earlier criticism of Aristotelian cosmology, as he maintained that the movement of the spots across the face of the Sun proved that Copernicus' system was correct,  and also that the Sun rotated.", "Having now spoken out publicly and decisively for the Copernican system Galileo faced increasing attacks from church authorities because of contradictions between the Copernican theory and the Scriptures, and in 1614 he was reported to the Inquisition.", "His work related to that of  Oresme, Buridan William of Ockham, Al Battani, Cortona,  Tartaglia, Roberval, Boyle,  Milton,   Mersenne, Gassendi, and Peiresc.", "It is not clear whether this trip precipitated the ultimate crisis, but in March 1616 a committee of consultors to the Holy Office declared that the proposition that the Sun is the immovable centre of the universe was heretical, and that the proposition of a moving Earth was theologically \"erroneous\".", "The Holy Office then told its leading Roman theologian, Bellarmine,  to ask Galileo to abandon \"realist\" Copernicanism, which was declared \"false and erroneous\", and Copernicus': 'De Revolutionibus' was put on the list of prohibited books.", "Galileo spent the next seven years (1616-23) in retirement at his house in Bellosguardo near Florence, in 1618-23 becoming involved in a dispute with Orazio Grassi over the nature of comets, which ended with the publication of his famous work, 'Il Saggiatore' ('The Assayer'), a brilliant piece on physical reality,  and an exposition of the new scientific method which included his famous pronouncement that the \"Book of Nature is... written in mathematical characters\".", "Praised work of Gilbert.", "He advised Christiaan Huyghens to patent his clock He was influenced by Witelo and the Council of Trent Venturi wrote about him His astronomy was followed up by  Borelli.", "He was later corrected by Fermat.", "During his time in Padua, he took a Venetian mistress, Marina Gamba, by whom between 1600 and 1606 he had two daughters and a son.", "He also corresponded with the Italian physician Santorio and the Italian physicist Baliani.", "In July 1609, while visiting Venice, Galileo learned of the recent invention of the telescope by the Dutch lens-grinder Lippershey in 1608, and on his return to Padua built one.", "On his return, Galileo turned again to physics, and published a book on the behaviour of bodies placed in water: 'Discourses on Things that Float' (1612).", "During these years he became convinced of the truth of the Copernicus' theory (that the planets revolve about the Sun) but was deterred from going public - as shown in his letter of 4 April 1597 to Kepler -   because of fear of the church (the Italian philosopher, Bruno had been arrested in 1592 and would in 1600 be burned at the stake for defending Copernicus. At Padua,  the leading scientific centre of the day, Galileo continued his research on motion, and around 1604 proved theoretically that falling bodies obey what came to be known as the law of uniformly accelerated motion (a body speeds up or slows down uniformly with time).", "Over the next few months he continued to work on the telescope, and by the end of 1609 he had improved it to a power of thirty-two, the practicable limit for a refracting telescope of this type, in which a convex (converging) objective lens and a concave (diverging) lens in the eyepiece together produce a magnified, upright image.", "Galileo then returned to Florence and spent the next several years working on his great book, 'Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo, tolemaico e copernicano' ('Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems - Ptolemaic and Copernican'), which he completed in 1630 and was permitted to publish in 1632.", "Inevitably, after a comparison of these two systems, Galileo came down heavily on the side of Copernicanism, and Urban VIII, feeling he had been tricked, summoned the old scientist to Rome in February 1633.", "No action was taken, but Galileo was alarmed enough by the news from Rome to decide in December 1615 to present his views there himself.", "In the summer of 1610 Galileo resigned from Padua, and returned to Florence as mathematician and philosopher to Cosimo II, with no teaching duties and a large salary.", "In Florence he continued his astronomical observations, and discovered spots on the surface of the Sun's disc, the oval appearance of Saturn, and that the planet Venus has crescent phases like the moon.", "Brewster wrote his biography He met Campanella.", "The Cassini family improved on his measurements His problems influenced Descartes, Hobbes,  Mariotte and Newton.", "Perhaps the most far-reaching of his achievements was his insistence that the \"Book of Nature is . . . written in mathematical characters\".", "From this base, he was able to found the modern experimental method.", "From 1585 to 1589 Galileo gave lessons in mathematics in Florence and Siena, and in 1586 he published an essay (describing his invention of a hydrostatic balance) which made him known throughout Italy, and won him the support of a wealthy patron, the Marchese del Monte, for whom he wrote a treatise on the centre of gravity in solids (1588) and who got him the job of lecturer in mathematics at the University of Pisa.", "In Pisa, Galileo began a controversial campaign to discredit accepted Aristotelian physics.", "From April to June 1633 Galileo was tried before the Holy Office and was found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", forced to abjure Copernicanism publicly, and sentenced to imprisonment.", "Late in August, Galileo arrived back in Venice with a nine-power telescope, three times as effective as those from Holland.", "In particular, Galileo saw in the moons of Jupiter a miniature planetary system,  thanks to which it could no longer be argued (as critics of Copernicus did)  that all moving heavenly bodies revolved exclusively around the Earth, Within two years he had constructed approximately accurate tables of the orbits of Jupiter's moons and suggested their frequent eclipses as a means of calculating longitude.", "Early in 1611 Galileo travelled to Rome, where he spent several months demonstrating his discoveries,  and winning the approval of the Jesuits of the Roman College, the pope and several cardinals.", "In 1624 Galileo returned to Rome, to visit the new pope, Urban VIII, who had been a longtime friend (and to whom he had dedicated 'Il Saggiatore') and got permission to write about \"the systems of the world\", both of Ptolemy and Copernicus, as long as he discussed them noncommittally and came to the conclusion dictated to him in advance by the pope - i.e. that humans cannot presume to know how the world is really made,  because God could have brought about the same observable effects in ways unimagined by them."]

what did hitler use to kill himself?	["Gunshot", "Suicide"]	["At the end of 1942, German defeat at el-Alamein and at Stalingrad brought the turning point in the war, and Hitler's character and way of life began to alter, his personal decline symbolized by his increasingly rare appearances and his self-enforced isolation in the 'Wolf's Lair' in the east Prussian forests.", "Hitler escaped with only minor injuries, however, and ordered the execution of all those implicated.", "His narrow escape convinced him that he had been chosen by God to lead the German people, and he drastically reduced the army's independence, appointing National Socialist political officers to all military positions.", "In December 1944 he moved his headquarters to Berlin, where he directed the German offensive in the Ardennes.", "By July 1933, Hitler had virtually removed the conservatives from any real participation in government, abolished the free trade unions, eliminated the Communists, Social Democrats and Jews from any role in political life, and had begun putting opponents in concentration camps.", "In June 1934, Hitler was confronted by serious opposition from within his own party, dissatisfaction and dissension centring around the SA and its leader, Captain Ernst Rohm, who were demanding more radical social reforms.", "Out of this grew the storm troopers (SA), organized in 1921 by Captain Ernst Rohm, and Hitler's black-shirt personal bodyguard force, the 'Schutzstaffel' (SS).", "At the same time, Hitler gathered around him several of Nazi leaders who later became infamous,  including Rudolf Hess (who introduced him to Haushofer's expansionist theory of \"Lebensraum\").", "By November 1923 Hitler was convinced that the Weimar Republic was on the verge of collapse, and together with Ludendorff and local nationalist groups he tried to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich.", "He refused to read reports of defeats, and those close to him, especially his secretary Martin Bormann, took care that only positive information reached him.", "In July 1943 the Allies captured Sicily and Mussolini's regime collapsed in Italy.", "In September 1943, the Allies invaded Italy, and then Normandy, France in June 1944.", "He then spent four years at the Linz Realschule, followed by a period at a boarding school in Steyr.", "Hitler failed to succeed in his studies and left school in 1905 to become a painter.", "After two idle years in Linz, in October 1907 Hitler left his mother (who was incurably ill with cancer) and moved to Vienna, where he remained until 1913 leading a bohemian existence, making a precarious living selling paintings and drawings of Vienna and producing posters and advertisements for small traders.", "Hitler was tried on 26 February 1924 and  sentenced to five years imprisonment at Landberg fortress.", "However, he was released after only nine months, during which he dictated to Hess his autobiography and personal testament 'Mein Kampf' ('My Struggle'),  published in 1925 and which by 1939 had sold five million copies, making Hitler a wealthy man.", "From these Hitler organized strong-arm squads to keep order at his meetings and to break up those of his Socialist and Communist opponents.", "This widening of the conflict into a world war by the end of 1941 finally drove Hitler to implement the 'Final Solution of the Jewish Question' which had been under consideration since 1939.", "He  directed Himmler to prepare the ground for the \"New Order\" in Europe, and the concentration camps in Poland were expanded, in preparation for what had now become a policy of the liquidation of all Jews under German rule.", "When it failed, he clutched at fantastic hopes that his 'secret weapons', the V-1 and V-2 rockets, would turn the tide of war.", "From January 1945 Hitler never left the chancellery bunker in Berlin.", "As the Red Army approached Berlin and the Anglo-Americans reached the Elbe, on 19 March Hitler ordered the destruction of what remained of German industry, communications and transport systems, and refused to allow his troops to surrender, effectively sentencing them to death.", "In March 1938, he forced Austria into 'Anschluss' (political union) with Germany, making a triumphantal entry into Vienna.", "On 29 September 1938, Hitler and Mussolini met at Munich with the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier, who agreed to the bloodless surrender of the Sudetenland by Czechoslovakia, and in March 1939 German troops entered Prague and the absorption of Czechoslovakia was complete.", "In August 1939, Hitler and Stalin signed a nonaggression pact,  freeing Hitler to turn his full attention to Western Europe.", "The attack against the U.S.S.R., racially and ideologically justified by Hitler as an anti- Bolshevik anti-Jewish crusade, was finally launched on 22 June 1941, with Hitler so confident of success that he announced it would be over in six weeks, and refused to provide winter clothing and equipment for his troops.", "Although the German army advanced fast into the Soviet Union, an unexpected counter attack in December 1941 made it clear that Hitler's plan for of a single campaign were wrong.", "A day later, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and Hitler declared war on the United States, although the German pact with Japan was purely defensive and he had not been informed of Japanese intentions.", "An early supporter was Lenard.", "Hitler left the army in 1920, and became party propagandist, editing the party newspaper the 'Volkischer Beobachter' ('People's Observer'), arranging frequent meetings, changing the name of the party to the National-sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (the National Socialist German Workers' Party, NSDAP or Nazi Party), imposing himself as its Chairman by July 1921, and giving the new Party its symbol - the swastika - and its greeting, 'Heil!'.", "The Nazi Party adopted the ideas Hitler had acquired in Vienna - violent racial nationalism, anti-Semitism and opposition to liberal democracy, combined with perverted versions of the philosophies of such German thinkers as Haeckel and Nietzsche - combined with a hatred of the post-war republican German government and 'socialistic' ideas of profit-sharing and nationalization.", "During the years 1930-33 Hitler's impassioned promises attracted members of all social groups in Germany, including industrial magnates, high-ranking army officials, prominent intellectuals (including the philosopher Heidegger and, until 1934, the cultural historian Spengler) and the wealthy members of the 'Landbund', or League of Land, who opposed the redistribution of land proposed by the Weimar Republic.", "Adolf Hitler was born in 1889 at Braunau am Inn, Austria, the son of a 52- year-old Habsburg customs official, Alois Schickelgruber Hitler, and his third wife, a young peasant girl named Klara Poelzl.", "Hitler attended a primary school in Braunau for five years, and then moved with his family to Linz, the capital of Upper Austria, on his father's retirement in 1897.", "From his experiences, Hitler had now learned that the road to power lay not through force alone, but through legal subversion of the Weimar Constitution, and he set out to build a mass movement empowered by a combination of parliamentary strength and extra-parliamentary street terror and intimidation.", "At first, development was slow.", "The mid-1920s saw a period of economic stability in Germany, and while in January 1925 the ban on the party was removed in Bavaria, allowing Hitler to speak in public, elsewhere prohibitions remained in force until 1927-28, and the Nazi Party won only 12 seats in the 1928 elections.", "On leaving hospital, Hitler returned to Munich, where he worked for the army as a political agent, spying on extremist groups like the nationalist and racist German Workers' Party (DAP), which Hitler joined in September 1919.", "He quickly showed a marked talent for inflammatory speaking, political agitation and party organization.", "In August 1914 he enlisted in the Sixteenth Bavarian Infantry Regiment, serving as a despatch runner on the Western front.", "Although he did not rise above the rank of Lance Corporal,  he proved himself an able and courageous soldier, wounded twice and awarded the Iron Cross, both first and second class, for conspicuous bravery.", "He was badly gassed four weeks before the end of the war and, temporarily blinded, spent three months recuperating in a hospital in Pomerania   During the war Hitler had found comradeship, discipline, and participation in conflict intensely satisfying, and in November 1918 learned with horror of Germany's defeat,  and of the humiliation of the armistice arranged  by the 'big three':  Lloyd George (UK) , Clemenceau (France) and Woodrow Wilson (US).", "In the 1932 elections, just after becoming a German citizen, Hitler opposed the aging Hindenburg in the presidential election, taking  36.8 percent of the vote on the second ballot and depriving von Hindenburg of the necessary absolute majority.", "Although Hindenburg won the majority in the run-off election held in July 1932, the Nazi Party emerged as the single largest party in Germany, obtaining nearly 14 million votes and 230 seats.", "Then, in spite of a decline in the party's votes to 11 million in November 1932, Hitler was helped to power by a deal with former Chancellor Papen, in which they secretly agreed to work together for a government in which Hitler would be chancellor and Papen's conservative supporters would hold important ministeries.", "His anti-Jewish laws caused physicist Born to be fired.", "On his release, Hitler began to rebuild the Nazi Party, which had disintegrated in his absence, with the help of Goering, Hess and Goebbels, and in 1926 he grabbed power from a rival Nazi leader, Gregor Strasser.", "However, the depression of 1929 enhanced the appeal for the Nazis, and Hitler found support among wealthy industrialists keen to finance a strong right-wing, anti-democratic government, which at last placed the Party on a secure financial footing.", "He also began preparing for the war of revenge he had promised in 'Mein Kampf.'  In 1935 he abandoned the Versailles Treaty, re-establishing universal military service, building a powerful air force, and persuading the British to sign a naval treaty recognizing Germany's right to rearm.", "From the first, Hitler held personal command of the armed forces and pushed his plans for total war against the conviction of army leaders ( particularly General Ludwig Beck, chief of the general staff) that Germany was not strong enough to defeat the Allied powers.", "The first phase of World War II was dominated by German 'Blitzkrieg' tactics - sudden shock attacks against airfields, communications, military installations, using fast mobile armour and infantry to follow up the first wave of bomber and fighter aircraft,  through which Poland was overrun in 19 days, Denmark and Norway in two months, and Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France in six weeks.", "After the fall of France in June 1940, Hitler then turned his attention to the invasion of Great Britain.", "The Battle of Britain, in which the Royal Air Force denied the Luftwaffe aerial control over the English Channel, was Hitler's first setback, and in October 1940 he cancelled the invasion code- named  Operation Sea Lion.", "He then turned his attention to the Balkans and North Africa, where his Italian allies had suffered defeats, and the German armies rapidly overran Greece, Yugoslavia, the island of Crete and Cyrenaica.", "With the failure of the British campaign, Hitler again looked eastwards, and began the long preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union, which would prove his most crucial decision of the war.", "On 29 July 1944 came the last of several attempts to assassinate Hitler when Colonel  von Stauffenberg exploded a time bomb at a conference at Hitler's field headquarters.", "On 29 April, having finally accepted the inevitability of defeat, Hitler married his long-term mistress Eva Braun and dictated his final political testament, appointed Admiral Donitz as head of state and Goebbels as chancellor, and concluded, \"Above all, I charge the leaders of the nation and those under them to scrupulous observance of the laws of race and to merciless opposition to the universal poisoner of all peoples, international Jewry.\" The following day, Hitler committed suicide with his wife and, in accordance with his instructions, their bodies were carried into the garden of the Reich Chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned (as documented by, for example, Trevor-Roper's^:  'The Last Days of Hitler', 1947).", "Influenced by theories of Mackinder and Gobineau.", "Had political connection with Benes.", "His 'Third Reich', which was to have endured forever, ended after twelve years of unparalleled brutality, in which 30 million people lost their lives, twelve million of them far from the battlefields:  by mass shootings, in forced labour camps and in the gas ovens of Belsen, Dachau, Auschwitz, Ravensbruck and other concentration camps in accordance with Nazi racial theories.", "Soon a million Allied troops were driving the German allies eastwards, while the Soviets came from the opposite direction.", "At last Germany had to face the fact that it lacked the resources equal to a struggle against a world alliance which Hitler himself had provoked.", "In 1936, he occupied and fortified the Rhineland,  with the Italian dictator Mussolini began sending military aid to Franco's fascist forces in Spain, and in October 1936 forged the Rome- Berlin Axis.", "In February 1938, he dismissed 16 senior generals and took personal command of the armed forces.", "Both the army and the judiciary passively accepted these murders, and at the beginning of August consented to the merging of the chancellorship and the presidency - with which went the supreme command of the armed forces of the Reich - and all officers and ministers took an oath of allegiance to Hitler personally.", "During the next four years (1934-38), helped by economic recovery and a reduction in unemployment, Hitler enjoyed a series of international successes which consolidated his power in Germany, and helped (along with Goebbels' propaganda) Germany to accept the  nazification of all aspects of German life, enforced by Himmler's Secret State Police (Gestapo) and the opening of concentration camps for political opponents and Jews, who were systematically persecuted.", "During this Vienna period (1907-13), Hitler read a great deal and absorbed many of the anti-Semitic, anti-liberal and anti-democratic ideas then common in Austria,  spread by, amongst others, the defrocked monk, Lanz von Liebenfels (whose theory of \"Theozoology\" divided humanity into two groups - Aryan supermen and animal subhumans), and the Austrian Pan-German leader, Georg von Schoenerer.", "From these and other sources, the young Hitler began to construct a vision of the world in which Jews (by race, rather than by religion) became the symbol and cause of all chaos, corruption, and destruction in culture, politics and the economy, and that the press, prostitution, syphilis, capitalism, Marxism, democracy and pacificism were all means exploited by 'the Jew' in his conspiracy to undermine the German nation and the purity of the creative Aryan race.", "In May 1913, Hitler left Vienna for Munich, Germany in order to avoid military training in Austria.", "Convinced that the natural field of expansion for German Lebensraum lay eastwards, on 1 September 1939 German armies invaded Poland (the independence of which was guaranteed by Britain and France), and two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany."]

what kind of equipment did isaac newton use?	["Reflecting telescope"]	["Between 1665 and 1667, Newton made revolutionary advances in optics, physics, and astronomy, and laid the foundations for differential and integral calculus, several years before Leibniz's  discoveries.", "The \"method of fluxions\", as he called it,  produced simple analytical methods that unified many existing techniques so as to solve problems like finding areas, tangents, the lengths of curves, and the maximums and minimums of functions.", "Also at this time, Newton began to think about gravity.", "He also was fascinated by the mechanics of Copernican astronomy as set out by Galileo and by Kepler's \"Optics\".", "In the simple case of circular orbit, the law of attraction followed from Kepler's Third Law (relating the times of revolution of the planets around the sun to the sizes of their orbits) together with Huyghens's 1673 expression for the centripetal acceleration of a body moving in a circle.", "The inverse problem of calculating the orbit from the law of force (which had baffled Hooke, Wren , Halley and others) was solved by Newton around 1680.", "Soon after, he also found the missing link in the identification of the force of terrestrial gravity by discovering that a spherically-symmetrical distribution of matter exerts the same attraction at external points as if its mass were concentrated at its center.", "Erasmus Bartholin's work questioned Newton's work on optics.", "He admired the work of Oughtred.", "During his third year at Cambridge, Newton went beyond the compulsory study of Aristotle and read the works of Descartes , Gassendi , Hobbes , and 17th-century chemist Boyle .", "His work related to that of Algarotti, Gregory, Stevin,  'sGravesende  Haukesbee, Wallis, Johann Bernoulli, Stevin, Cavendish, Ferrel, Copernicus, Peiresc and William of Ockham.", "Late in 1679, Hooke wrote to Newton describing his analysis of planetary motion.", "This led to an exchange between the two on the subject of elliptical orbits.", "The idea of a law of attraction according to the inverse square of the distance between the sun and the planets was now a topic of wide discussion in scientific circles.", "In a discussion of the shape of the orbit under the inverse square law of attraction towards a fixed center, Newton suggested the shape would be an ellipse, and promised to send Halley the calculation from which he had calculated the answer.", "Three months later, Halley received a short tract, (\"On Motion\") which at Halley's request was registered with the Royal Society in early 1685.", "This tract, which over the next two years Newton expanded, formed the basis of the first book of \"Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica\" (\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\") or the \"Principia\", as it commonly known.", "It was acknowledged that though Leibniz's discoveries were later in time, he preceded Newton in publishing a full account.", "Newton was given a state funeral and was buried in Westminster Abbey.", "Voltaire remarked that England had honored a mathematician as other nations had honored a king.", "Now obliged to deliver an annual course of lectures, Newton chose optics as his first subject.", "Over the next three years he summarized his findings in an essay, \"Of Colours\", which  became Book One of his \"Opticks\",  published in 1704.", "Newton knew or worked with Tillotson, Sprat, Leeuwenhoek, Grew, Sloane and Arbuthnot.", "In 1672, Newton published an account of his findings on white light in the Royal Society's \"Philosophical Transactions\".", "The paper provoked skepticism from the curator of the Royal Society, Hooke , and, on the Continent, from Christiaan Huyghens .", "Both objected to Newton's attempt to prove by experiment alone that light consisted of the motion of small particles.", "Newton influenced Cheselden, Dalton, De Moivre, Maupertius, Buffon, Winthrop, Hales, Pieter van Musschenbroek and Whiston.", "In 1669, Barrow decided the world must know about Newton's mathematical achievements and sent Newton's preliminary work, \"On Analysis by Infinite Series,\"  to John Collins in London.", "He also said he thought light consisted of the motion of small particles, rather than waves.", "Barrow then resigned his Lucasian Professor's chair to make way for Newton.", "He wondered whether the force that pulled an apple to the ground could also pull the Moon into an orbit around the Earth.", "From 1664, he recorded his thoughts in a notebook he called \"Certain Philosophical Questions\".", "He studied higher mathematics under Professor Isaac Barrow , who recognized Newton's genius and encouraged him.", "He assumed that the rate of fall is proportional to the force of gravity and that this force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the Earth.", "He then worked out what the motion of the Moon would be if these assumptions were correct, but obtained a figure that was too low.", "Disappointed, he set aside his figures and did not return to them until about 12 years later.", "Newton turned his attention to the nature of light.", "Contemporary scientists believed that white light was a basic single entity, but the chromatic aberration seen in a telescope lens convinced Newton otherwise.", "Passing a beam of sunlight through a prism, he observed that the beam spread into a colored band of light (spectrum), and from this he argued that sunlight is really a combination of all the colors.", "In 1675, when Newton published another paper on the color phenomena in thin films, he annoyed Hooke again, this time because Hooke thought Newton had stolen some of his own optical results.", "In this paper, Newton demonstrated the existence of periodic optical phenomena: he had discovered concentric colored rings in the thin film of air between a lens and a flat sheet of glass and calculated that the distance between these concentric rings (\"Newton's rings\") depended on the thickness of the film of air.", "In the summer of 1684, Halley visited Newton at Cambridge to discuss orbital dynamics.", "With Halley's help, the \"Principia\" was published in 1687 and hailed as a masterpiece.", "The \"Principia\" contained Newton's three laws of motion (now known as Newton's Laws: laws of inertia, action and reaction, and acceleration proportional to force),  his theory of tides and lunar motion,  and his theory of gravitation as a universal law of attraction between any two objects.", "His gravitational law declared that the force of gravity is proportional to the masses of the objects and decreases in proportion to the square of the distance between two bodies.", "His laws of motion laid the basis for classical mechanics.", "His theory of gravity was particularly important in working out the motions of the planets.", "By their application, Newton formulated the universal laws of nature with which he was able to solve virtually all the unsolved problems of his day.", "In 1689, Newton campaigned for a seat in Parliament and became Member for Cambridge.", "While in London, he met famous diarists Evelyn and Pepys and philosopher Locke .", "However, in 1692, the strain of his studies and his scientific disputes, especially with Leibniz, Flamsteed and Hooke, cast him into a severe depression and rumors spread that he had gone mad.", "In 1696, he was appointed Warden of the London Mint, becoming Master of the Mint in 1699.", "In 1703, he was elected President of the Royal Society, an office he held until his death.", "In 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne.", "A constant preoccupation for Newton was the continuing fight with Leibniz over who first invented calculus.", "A Royal Society panel, including Halley and mathematician William Jones ,  decided that Newton was the first to unify and make explicit what had been latent in the work of various forerunners.", "\"Principia\" was translated into French by du Chatelet in 1759.", "The physicist Brewster wrote his biography.", "He met Romer.", "One of the greatest scientists of all time."]
